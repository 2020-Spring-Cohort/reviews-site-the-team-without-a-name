        <p>I purchased a Honda Civic. I thought this was a reliable car. I have less than 13,000 miles and have had
          three batteries. (The one it came with and two more.) I had to take it in because it would hesitate when I
          would turn right. They were unable to duplicate. The module display went bad and it had to be replaced. When I
          asked why so many batteries the service department said, "I don’t know." I called the Corporate office and
          they said I don’t drive the car enough. I will never ever buy or suggest that anyone buy a Honda. I feel I
          have a lemon and Honda has not been helpful at all. Please do not buy, if you have a problem with the car you
          are on your own.</p>

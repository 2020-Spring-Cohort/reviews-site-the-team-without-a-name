Hello, and thank you for viewing our site Fast Track to Nowhere.
This application allows you to read previously submitted reviews.
Add a comment or hashtag, and submit your very own review for others to read and comment on.
Looking at the navigation bar at the top you can see the Categories section - here you have the ability to view vehicle types that have already been reviewed. After selecting a vehicle type you will be taken to the individual reviews for that specific car. The text boxes on the right will give you the option of adding a review of your own. Once you select a single review you will be able to add your own comment and hashtag.
Now, if you return to the categories page, there is a text box that allows for additional categories to be added. Select your newly added category and you can now add a review!
If you have already noticed there is also a hashtag section up at the top. Select them, and you will see a list of all the current hashtags being used. And once you click on a single hash, you will then see all the reviews that have that specific tag.
